# Journey to the cloud
This article is to present how to adopt the cloud leveraging the existing materials develop by IBM Cloud Architecture and Solution engineering team.

## Why Cloud?
The most important value points:
* rapid deployment, scalability, ease of use, and elasticity to adapt to demand
* predictable cost, optimized for workload demand
* enable DevOps, increase developers productivity
Private cloud adds:
* knowledge of where data resides
* apply own enterprise own security and governance policies
* simplify integration to on-premise business functions

[IBM Public Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/) value proposition:
* Easy migration
* Adopt cloud native development and operations
* AI Ready
* Hybrid integration
* Secure: continuous security scanning for apps and data
* Easily integrate and manage all your data across vendors and clouds â€” on or off premises

This is the technology for innovation and transformation. AI, blockchain, multi-cloud, SaaS integration, single page app are drivers for cloud adoption. The new application landscape integrate existing data centers, private cloud within corporate firewall and SaaS, Public cloud provider, IoT, traditional B2B...
The new landscape will be multi-cluster & multi-cloud.

IBM Cloud public offering offers a set of added value services to manage data, app development, devops, access, security, AI, blockchain... See the [catalog of services and capabilities here.](https://console.bluemix.net/)

## [Private Cloud reference architecture](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/architectures/private-cloud)
IBM Cloud Private brings cloud innovation within your datacenter. It is a Kubernetes platform with optimized scheduling, with most of the IBM Middleware products moving to it and it...:
* supports better cluster management, security capabilities, image repositories, routing services, and microservices mesh
* authorizes infrastructure automation with scripts (Terraform, [IBM Multi Cloud Manager](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/smartpapers/multicloud-management/))
* provides monitoring for container-based applications for logging, dashboards, and automation.
* supports network and storage policy-based controls for application isolation and security, and automated application health checking and recovery from failures

## Challenges to solve
We can group the challenge to face into categories:
* Application ARCHITECTURE and DEVELOPMENT practices:
 * Microservices
 * New Languages & Runtimes
 * APIs management and coherence
 * DevOps, continuous delivery & Skills
* Application PORTABILITY
 * Regulation and multi regions deployment
 * Cloud provider availability
 * Cost and quality of services
* INTEGRATION
  * APIs definition & Management
  * Integrating existing Applications and SOA services
  * Support transactions
  * Leverage and coexist with existing ESB
  * Agility for new integration needs
* DATA MOVEMENT & GOVERNANCE
  * New Analytics & AI Services
  * Data Privacy & Risk
  * Data Gravity & Performance
  * Network Cost
  * Data Gravity & Lock-in
* SERVICE MANAGEMENT
  * Monitoring/SRE
  * SLAs
  * Problem Diagnosis
  * HA/DR
  * Scale & Dynamicity
* SECURITY & COMPLIANCE
  * Identity & Authorization
  * Audit
  * Shared Responsibility Models
  * Regulatory Compliance

### Taking existing WebSphere workloads to cloud deployment
* 10-15% of app can be moved as-is to cloud.

#### Lift and shift
* Java based lift and shift
 A Traditional JEE app running on WebSphere Application server can be lift and shift to WAS on IBM Cloud. The [Inventory Data Access Layer](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-integration-inventory-dal) is a JaxWS application exposing a SOAP APIs. The figure below shows the deployed app in the IBM console   
 ![](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-integration-inventory-dal/blob/master/docs/twas/wasnd-deploy-8.png).  
 The application is accessing a DB2 via JDBC. [Deployment explanation on tWAS](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-integration-inventory-dal/blob/master/docs/twas/readme.md)
 We are presenting how to move an integration solution to IBM Cloud in this article: [Lift and shift of an integration solution](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-integration/tree/master/docs/toSaaS).

 With a deep dive Java EE migration path in [this repository](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/blob/master/phases/phase1.md)

 A [migration strategy tool](http://whichwas.mybluemix.net/) to support migration. [WAS V9 TCO Calculator](https://roi-calculator.mybluemix.net/).

 The Transformation Advisor application [deployable on ICP](https://ibm-dte.mybluemix.net/ibm-websphere-application-server-cloud-enabled)  

 [The Migration Toolkit for Application Binaries](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/#asset/tools-Migration_Toolkit_for_Application_Binaries) provides a command line tool that quickly evaluates application binaries for rapid deployment on newer versions of WebSphere Application Server traditional or Liberty.

 Finally the [source migration toolkit](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/#asset/tools-WebSphere_Application_Server_Migration_Toolkit) is an Eclipse-based Migration Toolkit provides a rich set of tools that help you migrate applications from third-party application servers, between versions of WebSphere Application Server, to Liberty, and to cloud platforms.

* MQ lift and shift  
We are presenting some [simple implementation](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-mq-messaging) using MQ on premise with MDB on WAS and a lift and shift path to [MQ on Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/mq) in [this note]()
The benefits to run MQ on cloud is that you keep your skill set but use cloud speed to:
* create queue manager in minute
* get product upgrade and patch done by IBM
* Pay as you use.
* Integrate with MQ manager on premise.  

* DB2 lift and shift
[We are presenting different approaches ](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-integration-inventory-db2/blob/master/docs/db2-cloud.md) to migrate DB2 database to DB2 on cloud.

### Refactoring app to microservices
Business wants to improve the application to increase client adoption and satisfaction. Monolitic applications are more difficult to change and moving to microservice architecture will bring velocity to the development team.

A need to shift from IaaS (VM, network, storage, security) to container and CaaS (kubernetes) and PaaS (cloud foundry).

[The process to start from an existing JEE to split into microservices is documented in this repository](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee)
[WebSphere on the Cloud: Application Modernization](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/08/websphere-on-the-cloud-application-modernization/)


### Innovate quickly with cloud native development
Leverage tutorials
* [Tutorial: Deploy a cloud-native application in Kubernetes](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/demo/try-private-cloud-install-an-app)

* Use one the available boiler plate, starting code.
[Nodejs, java, python, go, swift boiler plates](https://console.bluemix.net/developer/appservice/starter-kits)

### Leverage public cloud services in a hybrid model

## DevOps

## Public cloud for dev and test
